# Scriptures of The Chosen

## Brand Reflection Questions

### Goals

* Email list signups
* Regular readers
* Shared articles
* Comments?

### Values

* Classically futuristic (think Verne), not vintage or retro
* Classy, not bougie
* Explorative, not authoritative
* Curious, not know-it-all
* Story-based, not purely theoretical
* Well-reasoned, not emotional

### Questions

1. **Who are you?**
    * Tyler Mercer, a software engineer, writer (**TODO** can I call myself a
      writer? It's strange that I could call myself a programmer without doing
      it for profit, whereas calling myself a writer that way feels weird 🤔),
      designer, and psychology enthusiast
2. **What do you have to say?**
    * Agency thinking can be cultivated, and doing so makes
      individuals, families, organizations, and societies more resilient
    * Tech can do more to promote agency thinking
3. **What aren't you?**
    * A toxic individualist---someone who advocates a primal
      look-out-for-number-one-ism, at the expense of the communal good.
    * A Norman Vincent Peale-esque positive thinking peddler
    * A self-help blogger / writer
4. **Why should people listen to you?**
    * I studied computer science and psychology at BYU, with the intent to
      create software that helps people.
    * Over the years, I've seen in my own life and in the lives of others from
      all backgrounds that agency---or what Bandura calls perceived
      self-efficacy---enhances desirable outcomes in virtually every area of
      life.
    * I graduated with a high GPA in a tough degree with a minor, while dealing
      with unmedicated ADHD. (**TODO:** maybe scratch this one? It's pretty
      self-helpy, and the implied "all I needed was to think right" is
      uncomfortably _Power-of-Positive-Thinking_-esque)
5. **What do you believe that all your competitors disagree with?**
    * Claims should be nuanced
    * "The Science" doesn't have all the answers --- not every claim needs a
      study backing it up, and not all claims that have them are legitimate
      (especially in psychology)
    * Story is a big part of how humans communicate deeply
6. **What values do you believe so strongly that you're willing to lose money
   rather than violate them?**
    * Preserving and promoting user agency is more important than making money
    * Individual privacy should be respected
    * Claims should be given appropriate nuance
    * Business incentives should be structured to minimize perverse incentives
      and prioritize user wellbeing
