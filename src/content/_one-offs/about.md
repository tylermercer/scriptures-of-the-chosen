allowing you to easily view the scripture passages referenced in the show.

## Who made this, and why?

Hi! I'm [Tyler Mercer](https://tylermercer.net), a Chosen fan, Jesus-follower, husband, and dad. Oh, and I daylight as a software engineer. 👨‍💻

I love watching _The Chosen_, but I found myself wishing there was some way to easily see the verses referenced in each episode. I started looking up the Bible verses I saw referenced in the show, recording them in a spreadsheet as I found them. Once I had a good number of them found, I cobbled this little site together. ✨

You might be thinking, "What's the catch? How do you make money from this?" I don't! This is, in a sense, a sort of micro-ministry. I believe it's important to read the actual text of the Bible. _The Chosen_ is a great way to learn about the stories of the Gospels, but on it's own, it's spiritually insufficient. There's power in knowing and loving the words of the Bible. Hopefully, this little site can help people crack those pages open and connect the entertaining stories of the show with the powerful book on which it's based. 📖

(For what it's worth, this site doesn't cost me anything, the way I have it set up right now. So you don't have to worry about me shutting it down due to a lack of funds, if that's your concern.)

Hopefully you find the site useful. 😊
